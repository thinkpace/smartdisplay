# Smartdisplay

This is a private DIY project to create something like a smart display. Currently, there a two versions available:

* [version1](version1): This version is using quite a lot of technologie to implement such a simple thing like a smart display. I'm not using it anymore, but it was fun to create it and learn all those things.
* [version2](version2): This version is basically just a python script which provides an endpoint to provide pictures and an HTML file which is using this endpoint to show pictures.
* There were earlier versions available but those have never been published.

This project targets specifically following topics:

* Show pictures (located on a NAS) on a display (quite obvious ...).
* Play with and learn about technologies. This is very important especially about technical decission which have been made.
